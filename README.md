# 4-10solver

## Description
This is a solver for the 4 = 10 android game challanging its users to find a
possible combination of given 4 numbers, to make the result equal to 10 with a
given set of operations.

My solution provides an extended way to solve this problem for `n` numbers with
a given set of operations using a set of parenthesis at most.

## Running the program
To run the program, use the following code in your terminal after cloning this
repository with
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Darshan-2021-11/4-10solver.git
```
and going to that directory using your favourite C++ compiler such as in g++,
use this
```bash
g++ all_possible_operations_equals_k_over_n_numbers.cpp -o
all_possible_operations_equals_k_over_n_numbers
./all_possible_operations_equals_k_over_n_numbers < inp
```
where the `inp` file has the configuration of the question or enter manually
the input asked and get one of the solution with given set of numbers and
operations.
